Yesterday, Firefox Marketplace notified us that [Finder](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/finder), our file search app for Firefox OS, has been disabled because of changes in the policies and direction of the Marketplace.

After 41 reviews with 5 stars, and solving a pain point which no one else solved during its time on Firefox OS, we’d say Finder lived a [healthy life](http://blog.applait.com/tag/finder).

A big thanks to all the people who helped build it, and who used it and spread all the love.

So long, Finder.

**[Update]** In another email, the Firefox Marketplace team notified us that our app “may have been disabled”. The fact that you still see it on the Marketplace shows that Finder was not among the apps that were disabled. However, Finder was built to solve the problem of having searching through multiple device storage units possible. With the move away from packaged APIs, Finder is not helpful in today’s context. If you still want to try it out, check out the [Finder repository on Github](https://github.com/applait/finder).


## Here are some memories
