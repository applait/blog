We launched [Finder](https:\/\/marketplace.firefox.com\/app\/finder) today. Finder lets you search and pick files from your device\u2019s storage through a simple interface. It also exposes a web activity through which you can use Finder to pick attachments for email, search multimedia files on your device to attach on Facebook and so on. This is the first preview release. We have big plans going ahead. We are looking for an early feedback for the idea. You can [download the app](https:\/\/marketplace.firefox.com\/app\/finder) from the Firefox Marketplace.\n\n[![Download from Firefox Marketplace](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/firefox-marketplace_badge-orange_172_60.png)](https:\/\/marketplace.firefox.com\/app\/finder\/)Update: [Finder 1.1 is released](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/41 \"Finder 1.1 released: What\u2019s new?\").\n\n\n## Why did we build Finder?\n\nWe noticed that there is no application which can search any kind of file on the device storage. Specially, applications needing a custom file type, that is not handled by the Gallery or Camera, need to implement their own file search mechanism. Take for example the PDF Viewer or the Ringtone Picker app.\n\nAlso, scrolling through a long list of images or audio files becomes painful if you have lots of them on your sdcard.\n\nFinder solves this problem by giving you a search driven interface. It is not a file browser or file manager. It is a file picker. That means, the interface is geared to show results file by file, instead of a folder based layout. You search for a file name and you get a list of all the files that match the name. You can then tap on the desired result and open it.\n\nIf you used Finder to search for file from another app, tapping on the result will send the file back to the app you had opened it from. It will not open the file itself there.\n\n\n## How does it look like?\n\nHere is how version 1.0.0 of Finder looks like:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_32\" style=\"width: 150px\">[![Initial screen of Finder](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/2014-10-03-18-59-06-176x300.png)](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/19\/2014-10-03-18-59-06#main)Initial screen of Finder\n\n<\/div><div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_33\" style=\"width: 150px\">[![Search results of Finder](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/2014-10-03-18-59-26-176x300.png)](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/19\/2014-10-03-18-59-26#main)Search results of Finder\n\n<\/div><div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_34\" style=\"width: 150px\">[![No results screen](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/2014-10-03-18-59-46-176x300.png)](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/19\/2014-10-03-18-59-46#main)No results screen of Finder\n\n<\/div><div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_35\" style=\"width: 150px\">[![Finder showing up in web activities](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/2014-10-03-19-00-13-168x300.png)](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/19\/2014-10-03-19-00-13#main)Finder showing up in web activities\n\n<\/div>\n## Introducing FinderJS\n\nAs we had talked about last month, we have been abstracting some of our works as independent libraries. Today we present to you this nifty little library that we call [FinderJS](https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finderjs). It provides an event driven API to access device storages. Developers can plug this library in their app and get simplify access to device storage.\n\nFinderJS is the backbone that runs the file search behind Finder. To avoid confusion, FinderJS is the JavaScript library and Finder the app we have built using that library.\n\nFor more details, check the [FinderJS Github repository](https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finderjs). You\u2019ll love it.\n\n\n## Finder is open-source\n\nWe have released Finder out in the open. So, if you want to learn how to use the FinderJS library or how to interact with web activities or if you are interested in contributing a patch to Finder, please take a look at the [Finder project page on Github](https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder).\n\nMost importantly, if you find issues with Finder or if you have suggestions for its improvements, please file an issue in the [Finder issue tracker](https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/issues).\n\n\n## Road ahead\n\nThe current release is a basic barebone file search. It does not have many of the useful features you may need at the moment. We are working on it. Here is what we plan for the next couple of months:\n\n- Preview a file before selecting it through Web Activity.\n- Search through specific file types, e.g. search only through images or videos.\n- Group search results into folders.\n- Restrict search by date.\n- Restrict search by folder.\n\nIf you have any feature in mind that you would like to see in future versions of finder, let us know in the comments below or, even better, [file a bug](https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/issues)!\n\nP.S. If you are wondering how long it took us to develop Finder, it took us 1 full day to build the FinderJS library and 1 full day to build Finder itself. That is why we say we can deliver a solution at less than half the time it would take an organisation to build their own stuff.\n\n\n## Update\n\n**Update as of October 10, 2014**: Finder is [ranking 5 star](https:\/\/marketplace.firefox.com\/app\/finder\/ratings) on the Firefox Marketplace with 11 reviews!

Today we present to you this nifty little library that we call <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finderjs\">FinderJS<\/a>. It provides an event driven API to access device storages. Developers can plug this library in their app and get simplify access to device storage.<\/p>\n<p>FinderJS is the backbone that runs the file search behind Finder. To avoid confusion, FinderJS is the JavaScript library and Finder the app we have built using that library.<\/p>\n<p>For more details, check the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finderjs\">FinderJS Github repository<\/a>. You&#8217;ll love it.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"finder-is-open-source\">Finder is open-source<\/h2>\n<p>We have released Finder out in the open. So, if you want to learn how to use the FinderJS library or how to interact with web activities or if you are interested in contributing a patch to Finder, please take a look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\">Finder project page on Github<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, if you find issues with Finder or if you have suggestions for its improvements, please file an issue in the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/issues\">Finder issue tracker<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"road-ahead\">Road ahead<\/h2>\n<p>The current release is a basic barebone file search. It does not have many of the useful features you may need at the moment. We are working on it. Here is what we plan for the next couple of months:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preview a file before selecting it through Web Activity.<\/li>\n<li>Search through specific file types, e.g. search only through images or videos.<\/li>\n<li>Group search results into folders.<\/li>\n<li>Restrict search by date.<\/li>\n<li>Restrict search by folder.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you have any feature in mind that you would like to see in future versions of finder, let us know in the comments below or, even better, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/issues\">file a bug<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>P.S. If you are wondering how long it took us to develop Finder, it took us 1 full day to build the FinderJS library and 1 full day to build Finder itself. That is why we say we can deliver a solution at less than half the time it would take an organisation to build their own stuff.<\/p>\n<h2>Update<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Update as of October 10, 2014<\/strong>: Finder is <a href=\"https:\/\/marketplace.firefox.com\/app\/finder\/ratings\">ranking 5 star<\/a> on the Firefox Marketplace with 11 reviews!

Could be commercial, but we needed the source.\n- We wanted something that will not hog up memory with unnecessary bloat.\n- We wanted something that does not pollute the DOM, resulting in clean and beautiful code.\n- We wanted something that we could easily extend and customize without much overhead.\n- We wanted something that will help us main zero technical debt for our apps.\n- **We wanted something that did not take too much decisions on our behalf.**\n\nApart from the top five requirements, the last one was especially important for us. None of us at Applait like being told around, especially by frameworks about how we should code.\n\nThe list of frameworks and libraries we tried out include Ionic, Angular, Chocolatechip UI, Onsen, Sencha and DevExtreme. We built five simple apps, one with each of these frameworks\/libraries, adding the type of DOM elements and interactions we will need for the final app, and stress tested for performance. But we quickly found out that none of these were going to match all our requirements.\n\nWe decided that we need to build our own UI (:grin:). We needed to write a basic MVC\/MVP engine that would handle just the routing, rendering and an event driven API. And then we had Riot.\n\n\n## Why we chose RiotJS\n\nThe choice was really simple, once we found it. [RiotJS](https:\/\/muut.com\/riotjs) matched all our requirements. It respected the last requirement more than any of the others. It gave us three simple things to work with: an event interface, a routing system and a simple template rendering method.\n\nThe documentation is not really the best one out there. In fact, it is somewhat misleading, unless you look straight at the API. But the demos are very helpful. The library itself is just around 4KB, so it is fairly simple to read through the code and understand what it does. It took some time, but then, we ended up with a highly extensible system.\n\nThe entire UI has been [made modular](https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/blob\/master\/js\/extend.js) using Riot\u2019s observable interface. [Individual modules](https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/tree\/master\/js\/ui) can plug in any functionality they need, and they have access to the [app\u2019s internal API](https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/blob\/master\/js\/findermodel.js) at all times. The templating engine in Riot (`riot.render()`) is really just a semi-sophisticated string replace method. That worked really well for us, because it gave us the control of fetching the template codes. The routing engine handles a `location.hash` based pattern, where [we can decide](https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/blob\/master\/js\/route.js) how a view is called.\n\nTo a programmer looking to prototype quickly with frameworks like Ionic, this doesn\u2019t make much sense. They would need these decisions taken on their behalf; the magic done behind the scenes. But, we wanted to build the science ourself. We wanted that power of customization. Riot gave that to us.\n\n\n## Using flexbox all through\n\nKids in near future won\u2019t remember the pain of vertically centering an element on a page. That\u2019s because they will have flexbox.\n\nOur target platform, Firefox OS, has been one of the early adopters of flexbox, and Firefox OS 1.3+ has a very strong support of the flexbox specification. The last version of Finder made partial use of flexbox, but this time we have the whole interface based on it. This has [resulted in a semantic markup](https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/blob\/master\/index.html) that users of Bootstrap would be jealous of. It has also reduced the amount of CSS drastically. The entire UI is drawn in about [370 lines of CSS](https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/blob\/master\/css\/app.css) code (including comments).\n\n\n## The bottom line\n\nWe put a lot of effort in making sure Finder has a very clean user experience. We re-thought Finder from ground up. We put in each requirement piece by piece. And as we always say, you probably don\u2019t need that library that everyone uses in their app. We hope you enjoy the experience and let us know how we can improve it!\n\nAnd, for the developers out there, if your app takes less than 1\/3rd of the memory that other apps need, it is a feature.\n\n\n","html":"<p>For the last one month we have been trying every available HTML5 UI frameworks on the planet to see what would eventually fit our bill for <a title=\"Finder 2.0 and FinderJS 1.1 \u2013  215% more love\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/77\">Finder 2.0<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How we decided our approach<\/h2>\n<p>Our requirements were multifold:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We wanted something open source.

It took some time, but then, we ended up with a highly extensible system.<\/p>\n<p>The entire UI has been <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/blob\/master\/js\/extend.js\">made modular<\/a> using Riot&#8217;s observable interface. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/tree\/master\/js\/ui\">Individual modules<\/a> can plug in any functionality they need, and they have access to the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/blob\/master\/js\/findermodel.js\">app&#8217;s internal API<\/a> at all times. The templating engine in Riot (<code>riot.render()<\/code>) is really just a semi-sophisticated string replace method. That worked really well for us, because it gave us the control of fetching the template codes. The routing engine handles a <code>location.hash<\/code> based pattern, where <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/blob\/master\/js\/route.js\">we can decide<\/a> how a view is called.<\/p>\n<p>To a programmer looking to prototype quickly with frameworks like Ionic, this doesn&#8217;t make much sense. They would need these decisions taken on their behalf; the magic done behind the scenes. But, we wanted to build the science ourself. We wanted that power of customization. Riot gave that to us.<\/p>\n<h2>Using flexbox all through<\/h2>\n<p>Kids in near future won&#8217;t remember the pain of vertically centering an element on a page. That&#8217;s because they will have flexbox.<\/p>\n<p>Our target platform, Firefox OS, has been one of the early adopters of flexbox, and Firefox OS 1.3+ has a very strong support of the flexbox specification. The last version of Finder made partial use of flexbox, but this time we have the whole interface based on it. This has <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/blob\/master\/index.html\">resulted in a semantic markup<\/a> that users of Bootstrap would be jealous of. It has also reduced the amount of CSS drastically. The entire UI is drawn in about <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finder\/blob\/master\/css\/app.css\">370 lines of CSS<\/a> code (including comments).<\/p>\n<h2>The bottom line<\/h2>\n<p>We put a lot of effort in making sure Finder has a very clean user experience. We re-thought Finder from ground up. We put in each requirement piece by piece. And as we always say, you probably don&#8217;t need that library that everyone uses in their app. We hope you enjoy the experience and let us know how we can improve it!<\/p>\n<p>And, for the developers out there, if your app takes less than 1\/3rd of the memory that other apps need, it is a feature.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Sun, 30 Nov 2014 18:50:11 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 30 Nov 2014 19:46:34 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 30 Nov 2014 18:50:11 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":77,"title":"Finder 2.0 and FinderJS 1.1 -  215% more love","slug":"finder-2-0-and-finderjs-1-1-215-more-love","markdown":"\nAfter one and a half month since [Finder 1.1](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/41 \"Finder 1.1 released: What\u2019s new?\"), we launched [Finder 2.0](https:\/\/marketplace.firefox.com\/app\/finder) today. All these days we were cooking our secret sauce that would make Finder more usable and will pack in more of Applait love. Finder 2.0 is a complete rewrite of Finder, making the code more modular, the UI more appealing and the search more accessible. The new version of Finder takes **215% less memory** than its predecessor. We also plugged in the latest release of FinderJS, making searches **230% faster**. Go give it a spin now!\n\n\n## [![Download from Firefox Marketplace](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/firefox-marketplace_badge-orange_172_60.png)](https:\/\/marketplace.firefox.com\/app\/finder\/)What we did in FinderJS 1.1\n\nLast week, we launched version 1.1 of [FinderJS](https:\/\/github.com\/applait\/finderjs), the library for searching files in the DeviceStorages of Firefox OS. Finder depends on FinderJS to provide easy access to DeviceStorages. To have the best out of Finder, we started optimizing it at the very core. The new version solves three major concerns that we had with the previous version:\n\n- we added a reliable way to predict when a search was completed,\n- we cut down the complexity in the `search` method, resulting in faster enumeration over the file system, and,\n- we added a reliable file count found in a search.\n\nFinderJS is built from the ground up to be an asynchronous library. It communicates through events and does not block the UI at all. To put it in simple words, FinderJS does not keep the client application waiting when it searches files. The moment it finds a matching file, it flings the file at the client application, which can then decide whatever it wants to do with the file. If there is something important happening in FinderJS, there is an event for that.\n\nWe did a benchmark on a Flame, running latest release build of Firefox OS 2.0.0-pre-release. We used a 4 GB sdcard on the device, filled with files, to search for files matching the name \u201cjpg\u201d. FinderJS 1.0 took 8.5 seconds (\u00b1 0.5 seconds) and FinderJS 1.1 took 3.5 seconds (\u00b1 0.2 seconds) to complete the search. That is a **242% speed boost in FinderJS 1.1**!\n\n\n## What\u2019s new and improved in Finder 2.0\n\nThe UI of Finder 2.0 is the first step to create a unified feel across apps made by Applait. The unified top navigation is one of the things we have worked on. It heavily draws influence from Firefox\u2019s mobile browser. It will be the place for the main action on an app, and will also serve as the heading and access to settings.\n\nApart from that, Finder 2.0 includes:\n\n- A new \u201cshare\u201d option, where you can share a file that you have searched in Finder, over bluetooth, messages or email. This is only available in normal mode, i.e. if you open Finder directly, instead of opening it to pick file from another app.\n- Smooth transitions between screens, making the UX more meaningful.\n- A detailed file view page where you can see more information about the file.\n- Support for showing file type in the search results through icons. Only a limited set of file type detection is available at the moment.\n- Huge performance improvements!\n\n### Performance improvement in Finder 2.0\n\nThis version of Finder is based on FinderJS 1.1. So, it has inherited the speedier search that FinderJS 1.1 has introduced. On the UI front, Finder 2.0 takes about 800KB to start up. A search with around 75 results takes the app memory up to 1.3 MB. Compared to that, Finder 1.1 took about 1.8 MB to start, and a search with 75 results took about 2.8 MB of memory. That is a flat **215% improvement in memory optimization in Finder 2.0**!\n\nIf those stats look impressive, read on to find [how we got to this level of speed and optimization](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/93 \"Building a new UI for Finder 2.0\")!

We\u2019ve just opened up access to Grouphone for our beta users a few minutes back!\n\nThose of you who had signed up for Grouphone [early beta access](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/123), check your mailboxes. The sweet little welcome email from Grouphone would guide you to get started.\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Well, what\u2019s Grouphone?\n\nGroup audio call, on your phone, and just that. More details: [blog.applait.com\/123](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/123).\n\nIn the *beta*, expect things to be very minimal. We\u2019ve tried our best to rule out possible issues at this stage. However, there may be some bugs which will show up here and there, or the call may not work at its best for the time being. Over the next two months, we will polish it up better and add more resources.\n\n#### How do I join Grouphone?\n\nRight now, Grouphone is in beta. Once we run our beta campaign successfully, and come up with the final version, everyone will be able to sign up. For the time being, Grouphone is only accessible to folks who requested the beta invitation.\n\nBut you can still join the calls!\n\n#### I don\u2019t get it; how can I join the call?\n\nYou need to have a Grouphone account to start a call. But, to join a call, you need only the call URL. So, if anyone has created a call, ask them to share the call URL with you so that you can join it.\n\n#### Is there an app for it?\n\nWe don\u2019t need an app for this. The idea behind Grouphone is to build it using standard technologies so that it runs on browsers of every possible modern platform who support WebRTC.\n\n#### No, in simple words\u2026 how do I use Grouphone?\n\nGet the latest Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome on your laptops\/desktops\/tablets\/phones. On iOS, use Google Chrome.\n\n#### Does it truly run \u201ceverywhere\u201d?\n\nThat\u2019s the dream. Sadly, there are too many walled gardens. Too much of platform fragmentation. We are people of the web. It runs on every device that supports WebRTC.\n\nWe\u2019ve tested Grouphone on Firefox and Chrome.

We&#8217;ve just opened up access to Grouphone for our beta users a few minutes back!<\/p>\n<p>Those of you who had signed up for Grouphone <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/123\">early beta access<\/a>, check your mailboxes. The sweet little welcome email from Grouphone would guide you to get started. <!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>FAQ<\/h2>\n<h4>Well, what&#8217;s Grouphone?<\/h4>\n<p>Group audio call, on your phone, and just that. More details: <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/123\">blog.applait.com\/123<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the <em>beta<\/em>, expect things to be very minimal. We&#8217;ve tried our best to rule out possible issues at this stage. However, there may be some bugs which will show up here and there, or the call may not work at its best for the time being. Over the next two months, we will polish it up better and add more resources.<\/p>\n<h4>How do I join Grouphone?<\/h4>\n<p>Right now, Grouphone is in beta. Once we run our beta campaign successfully, and come up with the final version, everyone will be able to sign up. For the time being, Grouphone is only accessible to folks who requested the beta invitation.<\/p>\n<p>But you can still join the calls!<\/p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t get it; how can I join the call?<\/h4>\n<p>You need to have a Grouphone account to start a call. But, to join a call, you need only the call URL. So, if anyone has created a call, ask them to share the call URL with you so that you can join it.<\/p>\n<h4>Is there an app for it?<\/h4>\n<p>We don&#8217;t need an app for this. The idea behind Grouphone is to build it using standard technologies so that it runs on browsers of every possible modern platform who support WebRTC.<\/p>\n<h4>No, in simple words&#8230; how do I use Grouphone?<\/h4>\n<p>Get the latest Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome on your laptops\/desktops\/tablets\/phones. On iOS, use Google Chrome.<\/p>\n<h4>Does it truly run &#8220;everywhere&#8221;?<\/h4>\n<p>That&#8217;s the dream. Sadly, there are too many walled gardens. Too much of platform fragmentation. We are people of the web. It runs on every device that supports WebRTC.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve tested Grouphone on Firefox and Chrome. It should, technically, run on any browser that supports WebRTC properly.<\/p>\n<h4>There are so many audio-chat apps.

Keep it comin\u2019!\n\nToday, we announce the second Beta wave, aka, Beta 2. And this is what it has in store for you.\n\n\n## Security\n\nThe first beta release did not have much focus on security. That was a prioritization we had to do to get the initial release out. But once that was out of the way, we had started working on making Grouphone more and more secure. We are happy to say that our friends all over the internet have helped us identify where we need to tighten up, and another huge thanks go out to them!\n\n### SSL on all layers\n\nGrouphone servers now run on full SSL.

This is what we have done to make up for that.\n\nNow your password does not remain in cleartext at any point between your browser and the database. At each layer it gets rehashed again, and, each of the rehashing is done with a different encryption salt at each stage. Even if someone gets through all these layers, they will still need these encryption salts to use the information they have. Plus, all these hashing is a one way street. Even if you have the hashed password and the salt, you can never get the original text out of it, at any stage.\n\nThis also means, even *we* don\u2019t have any access to your cleartext password.\n\n#### Need new passwords\n\nAs a side-effect of this upgrade, your existing passwords will not work any more. We have to sent out reactivation emails for existing accounts, and this is going to be a one time thing! If you already have a Grouphone account, you will need to reactivate it following the link in that email, or you can always request a new activation link through \u201cForgot Password\u201d at **grouphone.me**.\n\n\n## Improved platform support\n\nWe have tested Grouphone to now work on latest Firefox and Chrome on Linux, OSX and Windows. We have ironed out some of the UI glitches as well, making the group call experience more reliable.\n\nIt currently works on Firefox for Android and Chrome on Android as well, and we are trying to improve the experience on mobile platforms.\n\n*There were issues with call disconnection, and now that has been cleared. Just to clarify here, if the call creator ends the call, it is actually supposed to end for all the participants currently connected to that call.*\n\n\n## Smoother and better feedback\n\nSome of you were not happy with sending feedback over email (but still you did, and we love you for that!). So, now, we have embedded a live chat widget. If you have feedback, you can directly give it from the app, or you can head over to [Grouphone\u2019s Scrollback channel](https:\/\/scrollback.io\/grouphone). We\u2019re listening!\n\n\n## Big thanks!\n\nWe have received a wide range of feedback over the past couple of weeks. Among all of them, we would especially like to thank [Jaipradeesh](https:\/\/mozillians.org\/u\/dolftax\/) for helping with the frontend development & [Sumantro Mukherjee](https:\/\/mozillians.org\/u\/SumantroMukherjee\/) for running full on security suite to generate report for us.

It\u2019s a brand new public beta launch, which targets some of the most reported & very well known browser\/platform compatibility issues and UX enhancements, among other things.\n\nSome of those fixes aren\u2019t very straight forward, as they\u2019re substantially more of moral issues, than technical ones. We\u2019ve tried to explain them in the later part of this post.\n\n\n## Public Beta\n\n**Grouphone opens up for public Beta!**\n\nPreviously, we had opened up limited access beta, where we\u2019ve had given access to a handful set of selected few users within two short time windows. This was to test the early implementations of the service, until we were satisfied with it.\n\nBut now we\u2019ve opened up the Public Beta, which allows you to request access to sign-up for the service whenever you want, [from the login page of the application](https:\/\/grouphone.me\/login). We\u2019re sending out the sign-up invitations in short bursts, so you won\u2019t even have to wait for many days.\n\nWe\u2019re still concerned about the infrastructure capacity, and as such, we\u2019re evaluating & scaling the infra as we go. Hence we\u2019re keeping the request-access model for the time being.\n\n\n## Browser Incompatibilities\n\nSadly, the web is way too fragmented than we would like it to be.\n\nFor example, Firefox has [major changes](https:\/\/hacks.mozilla.org\/2015\/03\/webrtc-in-firefox-38-multistream-and-renegotiation\/) in WebRTC implementations in version 34, 37 & 38 from developers\u2019 point of view.\n\nThat\u2019s just one browser. There are protocol implementation differences for each browser, across releases, each with pros and cons of their own. Overall it\u2019s a massive moving target.\n\n**What we solved:** issues with getting audio-stream; as in \u2013 not being able to hear the other participant(s) \u2013 should be fixed for 90% of the reported cases. For the rest of the 10%, it is often fixed by reloading the page. *Please note*, sometime it may also be because of low\/muted \u201cMedia Volume\u201d set by the user on Android handhelds, but that\u2019s rarer.\n\n\n## Platform Support\n\n**Grouphone doesn\u2019t work on iOS:** and it won\u2019t. Not in foreseeable future.\n\nNot only in Safari, but in Chrome for iOS as well. The reason being, the underlying layer for them aren\u2019t different on iOS & Apple forces browser vendors to use [their version of WebKit](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/a\/29164511), which doesn\u2019t support WebRTC. There\u2019s barely anything we can do about it, [save the lulz](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kaustavdm\/status\/602150045534822400).\n\n**Grouphone doesn\u2019t work reliably on Firefox OS version less than 2.0:** and again, it wont. The WebRTC implementation on lower versions of Firefox OS (1.4, 1.3, 1.1 etc.) are way too obsolete, and requires a truck load of non-standard implementations & hacks.\n\n\n## UX enhancements\n\n**We\u2019ve fixed the \u201cCall End\u201d button not ending calls properly** for Google Chrome on Touch screen devices; and in that process, have implemented a better touch vs click event handling mechanism for the entire application.\n\n**Also, we\u2019ve patched Grouphone for better interaction-feedback**, so the call creation, connectivity, user count, browser\/platform is incompatibility etc. are much more transparent. Instead of failing silently (which is confusing & frustrating), Grouphone now will throw particular tantrums, while pointing fingers at the right direction.\n\n![yuno](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/yuno-300x300.jpg)\n\n[![WebRTC incompatibility in stock Android browser](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Screenshot_2015-05-25-12-27-35-169x300.jpg)](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Screenshot_2015-05-25-12-27-35.jpg)\n\n\n## Web Standard Compliance\n\nIn last few weeks, we had to make some choices. Choices around technical feasibility vs. feature richness vs. user experience. At the end of the day, we ended up taking the red-pill.\n\nHence, for example, making the Copy URL to Clipboard isn\u2019t difficult to implement using Flash. In fact, it\u2019s way too trivial \u2013 compared to the rest of the pieces of technology. But we chose not to use Flash. We know it\u2019s a little less convenient for the user, and we\u2019re aware that we\u2019ll keep on facing the complains \u201cwhy don\u2019t you implement Copy URL feature?\u201d \u2013 and, we\u2019re okay with it, until a proper web-native solution appears. Till then, we have a small workaround for you: the URL gets updated for you to the call join link. So, **you can directly share the URL using your browser\u2019s \u201cShare\u201d option on Android**.\n\nThe same goes for many other lower level choices (from unification of SDP negotiation compliance at the protocol layer to flexbox layout at the interface layer), which is beyond the scope of this blog post.\n\nWebRTC in itself is a pretty new technology, and it\u2019s on the bleeding edge. Check this following table to understand how much more work it needs to get stable.\n\n[![webrtc-compat](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/webrtc-compat.png)](http:\/\/blog.applait.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/webrtc-compat.png)\n\n\n## But, wait!\n\nWhile the big enterprise players are pondering, cowering, squinting eyes & reevaluating to take a shot at it, a handful of folks from Applait brings you a fully-functional group audio call service, using WebRTC.\n\nWhile we could have written shims to cover these gaps and bridge the fragmentation, that was not the promise of the open web. Grouphone is a project to see how much the web has progressed on the \u201copen\u201d front. We intend to keep it that way.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, and it definitely wasn\u2019t as simple as it may look like. But we\u2019re hopeful, your Grouphone experience will get better as the spec gets better \u2013 in web technology, as it always does.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Yesterday we&#8217;ve released the Beta 3 of <a href=\"https:\/\/grouphone.me\">Grouphone<\/a>.

So, <strong>you can directly share the URL using your browser&#8217;s &#8220;Share&#8221; option on Android<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The same goes for many other lower level choices (from unification of SDP negotiation compliance at the protocol layer to flexbox layout at the interface layer), which is beyond the scope of this blog post.<\/p>\n<p>WebRTC in itself is a pretty new technology, and it&#8217;s on the bleeding edge.
