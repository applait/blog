Hello, World! Rejoice! Soon weâ€™ll be launching a group audio call service for smartphones, called â€œ[**Grouphone**](http://grouphone.applait.com)â€œ. It is just a simple app for your smartphone that will do just one thing: let you have audio conversations with multiple friends at a time, using the internet.

Weâ€™re bringing it first to Firefox OS in March 2015. Weâ€™ll bring it to Android and iOS in the next few months.


## Why Grouphone?

This has 2 answers:

0) You have many other smartphone apps that let you call over the internet. Usually, they also do a lot more things than that, e.g. group chats. Grouphone is focused on giving you a good group audio call conferencing experience; minus the distractions.

1) Firefox Hello is already available and it gets to the point of using web as a platform for connecting friends. But given its decentralized nature, it can connect only two people at a time. Weâ€™re extending that to bring audio calls to entire group of people on Firefox OS, as nothing such is yet available on that platform. And, it will work on even 3G connections.

Whatâ€™s more: Weâ€™re going to keep Grouphone **Forever Free for Firefox OS** â€“ thatâ€™s just to appreciate Mozilla on building an open mobile ecosystem. Hi5!
