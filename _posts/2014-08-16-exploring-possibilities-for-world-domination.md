We have more or less stabilized the early version of our app testing platform. A few issues have been ironed out and now it is ready for bulk use. So, folks, meet [Explore](http://explore.applait.com). The app testing platform we had been talking about for the past couple of months.

Before we begin, let us tell you what Explore is not:

- It is *not* an alternative to the [Firefox Marketplace](http://marketplace.firefox.com). It does not ever aim to be.
- It does *not* provide access to privileged and certified APIs for apps that are hosted here.

Simply put, Explore is currently a budding platform where you quickly test your responsive web site on Firefox OS with a few clicks, saving you about 15 precious minutes that you would have spent creating a manifest for your app and pushing it to your device. It is still in an early phase, and we plan to make it into a full blown testing suite for developers to test their apps. Half a year down the line, we see Explore as the necessary collaborative QA pass before you push your apps to the Firefox Marketplace.


## We’re taking things seriously

Oh, and we’ve started the process of incorporation. For now, we will be based out of a shared office space in Bangalore (but honestly, we always work remote). [Applait ](http://applait.com)is not just an idea now. It is real. Growing up each day. The legal system, well, is as legal systems go, very slow. So, hopefully, we will be a legal entity soon! Watch out for updates!
